In this question, we need to a build an interactive bar chart similar to velocity charts we see in Atlassian's JIRA product.

Functional Requirements
There should be a button that can be used to toggle the visibility of the chart.
Department data would be provided using which we need to draw a Bar chart where Y axis represents the no. of tickets and X axis represents the departments.
Each bar should be scaled based on the highest no. of tickets.
Each bar should have a tooltip that displays department name along with no. of tickets when a bar is hovered.
Bar's height should animate from 0 to final value upon entry and exit.
